# Library Project
This is the final project for the PAO (Advanced Object-Oriented Programming) course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics UNIBUC.  It contains a Java aplication for a Library.

This is a Java program that simulates a library system. It imports several packages and classes from the "domain", "exceptions", and "service" folders. The main class initializes the services and the library catalog, which consists of books, records, and CDs.
